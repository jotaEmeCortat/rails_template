Professional Rails 7.1+ template with three frontend options, CI/CD, and
production-ready deployment configuration.

## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Quick Start

Create a new Rails application with your preferred frontend:

```sh

```

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Interactive Commits

To make this easier, a **custom Bash script** (`bin/commitizen`) is provided —
**no Node.js required**.

### ✅ How to use

#### Add an alias to your shell config:

Append this line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
alias cz="bin/commitizen"
```

Then reload your shell:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
# or
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Make commits using:

```sh
cz
```

### Environment Setup
